# MyReads Project

Project Purpose:
This app was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

This project is a Goodreads like app that places books into 'shelves' based on whether you are 'currently reading' 'want to read' or 'read' a book from a selection. There is also a Search feature that lets you do limited searches through a list of books. 

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
